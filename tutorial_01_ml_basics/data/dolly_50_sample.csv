What is the third limb of yoga?,"sanas originated in India. In his Yoga Sutras, Patanjali (c. 2nd to 4th century CE) describes asana practice as the third of the eight limbs (Sanskrit: अष्टाङ्ग, aṣṭāṅga, from अष्ट् aṣṭ, eight, and अङ्ग aṅga, limb) of classical, or raja yoga.","The third limb of yoga is know as Asana.  This refers to the physical practice of yoga, or the yoga postures.  By putting the body into difficult positions you achieve several key benefits. The first is you are helping your body heal pain.  If you want to meditate and work on healing your mind, you need to first heal your body.  Otherwise your easily distracted mind will focus on pain in your body versus the pain in your mind.  Secondly, commitment to the Asana will teach you the discipline your mind needs to heal.  When going into uncomfortable situations, bad patterns in the mind often arise.  Stepping into discomfort actually becomes an opportunity to study the mind and change patterns of response.",summarization
"Summarize the meaning of ""Lovers"" in the slogan ""Virginia is for lovers""","""Virginia is for Lovers"" is the tourism and travel slogan of the U.S. commonwealth of Virginia. Used since 1969, it has become a well-recognized and often imitated part of American jargon. In 2012, Advertising Age called ""Virginia is for Lovers"" ""one of the most iconic ad campaigns in the past 50 years.""

History
A team led by David N. Martin and George Woltz of Martin and Woltz Inc. of Richmond, Virginia created the slogan after winning the Virginia State Travel account in 1968. Originally, they had come up with history ads, ""Virginia is for History Lovers""; beach ads, ""Virginia is for Beach Lovers""; and mountain ads, ""Virginia is for Mountain Lovers"". This approach was eventually discarded as too limiting, and the qualifiers were dropped. Martin and Woltz Inc. eventually gained prominence and grew to become The Martin Agency. The Martin Agency says that, contrary to some claims, the slogan is not a reference to the United States Supreme Court's 1967 ruling in Loving v. Virginia, which legalized interracial marriage in the United States.

In 1969, the Virginia State Travel Service (now the Virginia Tourism Corporation) adopted the ""Virginia is for Lovers"" slogan and the first ad campaign using the tagline appeared in March 1969, in an issue of Modern Bride.

In 2009, ""Virginia is for Lovers"" was inducted into the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame, a creation of Advertising Week, the largest collection of advertising, marketing and media professionals in North America. These inductees were also included in the Advertising Icon Museum. Also in 2009, ""Virginia is for Lovers"" was acknowledged as one of the top ten tourism marketing campaigns of all time by Forbes.com. In 2016, the Virginia Tourism Corporation began selling apparel with a rainbow-colored heart in the logo as part of an LGBT tourism promotion campaign. The slogan began appearing on the state's license plates in 2014 and the state's welcome signs in 2015.

In popular culture
The slogan has been mentioned by a variety of artists over the years. In 2005, post-hardcore band Hawthorne Heights alluded to the phrase in the title of their single “Ohio Is for Lovers,” which would become widely regarded as an anthem of the early 2000’s emo music scene. American Idol winner Jordin Sparks recorded a song called ""Virginia is for Lovers"" in 2007, which was featured as a bonus track on her self-titled debut album. The slogan is mentioned in The Hold Steady song ""Killer Parties"", and Willie Adler, guitarist for Lamb of God, has the slogan printed on the neck of his custom guitars. The slogan is also mentioned in the Kenny Chesney song ""Get Along"". Virginia Beach-based rap group Clipse include the slogan in their song ""Virginia,"" from their 2002 album Lord Willin', proclaiming: ""Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here / For out-of-towners, who think they're gon' move weight here.""","- ""Virginia is for Lovers"" is a tourism and travel slogan adopted by the Virginia State Travel Service (now the Virginia Tourism Corporation) since 1969
- The ""lovers"" in the slogan was originally attached to qualifiers such as history lovers, beach lovers, and mountain lovers. The qualifiers were considered too limited and eventually dropped
- Contrary to claims, the word ""Lovers"" in the slogan bears no reference to the United States Supreme Court's case Loving v. Virginia which legalized interracial marriage in  1967",summarization
why do human beings have a tendency to think they are always right?,,"As a first attempt to answer the question of why human beings have a tendency to think they are always right, we could point to cognitive biases, and in particular to one called ""confirmation bias"". This bias conditions human beings to use any new evidence to confirm their pre-existing beliefs, and to reject any new evidence that contradicts these beliefs. People may also experience the so-called illusory superiority, another bias that conditions them to overestimate their skills and make them believe they are superior to the rest. However these biases, as concrete as well-proven as they are, are only part of the explanation. The book ""Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error"" by Kathryn Schulz is an exploration on why humans have the tendency to disregard errors and think they are always right. Shulz describes how people start with the assumption that they are right in everything they believe, and when they realise they have made a mistake, instead of challenging this assumption, they actually feel relief and think: ""I was right except for this particular error I was making, but now that I have realised it I can certainly say that I am 100% right in everything"".",general_qa

What are the merits of skipping breakfast? Can you target your answer to a typical American and describe in layman's terms rather than detailed scientific jargon?,,"A truism instilled in youths is ""Breakfast is the most important meal of the day"". A well-rounded breakfast may indeed lead to a productive and energetic day. However, advertisements often position breakfast as a dessert rather than a well-rounded meal. For example, many eat sugary cereal with large servings of milk to kickstart their day. This is ill-advised. One should consider a glass of water or cup of coffee in place of breakfast. Skipping breakfast creates a ""fast"" in the body, which allows restoration of vital biological functions without spending cycles digesting new nutrients. In short, if one skips breakfast, additional time and focused energy may be awarded, especially if the breakfast has a poor nutrient profile.",general_qa
How do you make wine?,"Winemaking (also wine making) or vinification is the production of wine, starting with the selection of the fruit, its fermentation into alcohol, and the bottling of the finished liquid. The history of wine-making stretches over millennia. The science of wine and winemaking is known as oenology. A winemaker may also be called a vintner. The growing of grapes is viticulture and there are many varieties of grapes.

Winemaking can be divided into two general categories: still wine production (without carbonation) and sparkling wine production (with carbonation – natural or injected). Red wine, white wine, and rosé are the other main categories. Although most wine is made from grapes, it may also be made from other plants. (See fruit wine.) Other similar light alcoholic drinks (as opposed to beer or spirits) include mead, made by fermenting honey and water, cider (""apple cider""), made by fermenting the juice of apples, and perry (""pear cider""), made by fermenting the juice of pears, and kumis, made of fermented mare's milk.","Winemaking is the process of using fruit for fermentation into alcohol.

Coach left a lasting, positive impact on so many of us. Pushing us not only to be better swimmers, but to be humble leaders and stronger, more confident adults. 

Even though I would never be a star swimmer or D1 athlete, I never felt discouraged by Coach or anyone on her coaching staff. Quite the opposite: I threw myself into swimming. We all pushed ourselves to be the best we could be, we cheered as loud as we could on the sidelines, and no one passed up an opportunity to support the team or attend a team outing. Because Coach didn’t just build teams of champion swimmers, she built a community. I’m still close to many of my teammates — some remain my closest friends.

Write a review of Carlos Ruiz Zafon's book The Shadow of the Wind,,"What a beautiful book; it reminds me of Murakami - magical yet still very grounded. The Shadow of the Wind has everything going for it: mystical Barcelona, heartwarming characters, poetic language, intriguing plot.

The language and setting of the book was amazing. Zafon is extremely talented, his words are elegant and poetic, and he paints Barcelona in a myriad of different ways: dark and gothic at night, or blissfully cheerful, or dreary gloom, all depending on the characters.

I loved the cast of Shadow of the Wind. Each character was well developed and given an appropriate backstory. They bumped into each other in mysterious turns, and their interactions, like Daniel and Clara, or Daniel and Nuria, were heart wrenching.

But most of all, Zafon tells a wonderful story. I loved the parallels between Julian Carax and Daniel, and how Daniel's life becomes entangled with Julian's. It makes it feel much more like magical realism, and makes for an entertaining read.",general_qa

The population grew from the South Asian Stone Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate, before population growth slowed down in the Early Medieval Era up to 700 AD, and then started decreasing the up to 1500 AD.

Under Mughal Empire, India experienced a high economic and demographic upsurge, due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production. 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India and contemporary Europe up until the 19th century. Those estimates were criticised by Tim Dyson, who considers them exaggerations. According to Dyson, urbanisation of the Mughal empire was less than 9%

Under the reign of Akbar (reigned 1556–1605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe. By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871. Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551–1621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.

Give me a summary of the paragraph in your own words and it should be short,"Recreational drug use is the use of one or more psychoactive drugs to induce an altered state of consciousness either for pleasure or for some other casual purpose or pastime. When a psychoactive drug enters the user's body, it induces an intoxicating effect. Generally, recreational drugs are divided into three categories: depressants (drugs that induce a feeling of relaxation and calmness), stimulants (drugs that induce a sense of energy and alertness), and hallucinogens (drugs that induce perceptual distortions such as hallucination).

In popular practice, recreational drug use generally is a tolerated social behaviour, rather than perceived as the medical condition of self-medication. However, drug use and drug addiction are severely stigmatized everywhere in the world. Many people also use prescribed and controlled depressants such as opioids, as well as opiates and benzodiazepines. What controlled substances are considered generally unlawful to possess varies by country, but usually includes cannabis, cocaine, opioids, MDMA, amphetamine, methamphetamine, psychedelics, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. As of 2015, it is estimated that about 5% of people worldwide aged 15 to 65 (158 million to 351 million) had used controlled drugs at least once.

Common recreational drugs include caffeine, commonly found in coffee, tea, soft drinks, and chocolate; alcohol, commonly found in beer, wine, cocktails, and distilled spirits; nicotine, commonly found in tobacco, tobacco-based products, and electronic cigarettes; cannabis and hashish (with legality of possession varying inter/intra-nationally); and the controlled substances listed as controlled drugs in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971) of the United Nations (UN). Since the early 2000s, the European Union (EU) has developed several comprehensive and multidisciplinary strategies as part of its drug policy in order to prevent the diffusion of recreational drug use and abuse among the European population and raise public awareness on the adverse effects of drugs among all member states of the European Union, as well as conjoined efforts with European law enforcement agencies, such as the Europol and EMCDDA, in order to counter organized crime and illegal drug trade in Europe.","Recreational drug use refers to using certain drugs for enjoyment or leisure purposes instead of for medicinal reasons. Some common recreational drugs include caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and synthetic drugs like ecstasy. While many countries consider recreational drug use legal, there are still laws surrounding their consumption and distribution. The EU has implemented various policies aimed at reducing recreational drug use and addressing issues related to drug trafficking within its borders.

People often take recreational drugs because they want to experience feelings of euphoria, increased energy levels, or enhanced sensory perception. However, these drugs can have serious side effects, including dependence, withdrawal symptoms, impaired judgment and motor skills, and even death. Additionally, recreational drug use can lead to legal consequences, financial problems, strained relationships, and health issues such as mental illness, organ damage, and overdose. Despite these risks, many individuals continue to engage in recreational drug use due to peer pressure, stress relief, or simply for the thrill of it. Overall, recreational drug use poses significant dangers to both individual users and society as a whole.",summarization
What is an Oxford comma and why do editors have such strong feelings about their use?,,"An Oxford comma is a comma before the last item in a series or list. For example take the following two statements:

I was chased by the fox, the bear and the dog.
I was chased by the fox, the bear, and the dog.

The meaning is the same but the second statement contains an Oxford comma.

Some say the Oxford comma adds clarity to some statements. This is apparent when there can be ambiguity between a list and an appositive. Take the following two example statements:

We went to dinner with our coaches, Chris and Terry.
We went to dinner with our coaches, Chris, and Terry.

The first statement can appear to imply that we went to dinner with two people whose names are Chris and Terry who are both our coaches. There is no such implication that can be extracted from the second statement. The second statement implies we went to dinner with at least 4 people: Chris, Terry, and at least two coaches. This type of ambiguity is what proponents of the Oxford comma latch onto in its defense.

On the other hand, opponents of the Oxford comma claim it should be avoided in favor of rewording sentences when necessary. The sentence:

We went to dinner with our coaches, Chris, and Terry.

Can easily be reworded as:

We went to dinner with Chris and Terry, as well as our coaches.

With 157 weeks on the Billboard 200 by December 2009, the album was the longest-charting album of the 2000s decade. Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), topped the Billboard 200 for 11 weeks and was the only album from the 2000s decade to spend one year in the top 10. The album was certified Diamond by the RIAA. It also topped charts in Australia and Canada, and has sold 12 million copies worldwide. Her third studio album, the self-written Speak Now (2010), spent six weeks atop the Billboard 200 and topped charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.",Fearless,information_extraction

What is geovisualization?,,"Geovisualization or geovisualisation (short for geographic visualization), also known as cartographic visualization, refers to a set of tools and techniques supporting the analysis of geospatial data through the use of interactive visualization.

Like the related fields of scientific visualization and information visualization geovisualization emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission.[To do this, geovisualization communicates geospatial information in ways that, when combined with human understanding, allow for data exploration and decision-making processes.

Traditional, static maps have a limited exploratory capability; the graphical representations are inextricably linked to the geographical information beneath. GIS and geovisualization allow for more interactive maps; including the ability to explore different layers of the map, to zoom in or out, and to change the visual appearance of the map, usually on a computer display. Geovisualization represents a set of cartographic technologies and practices that take advantage of the ability of modern microprocessors to render changes to a map in real time, allowing users to adjust the mapped data on the fly.",open_qa
"here is a blurb about byte pair encoding for encryption, what benefits does this concept have besides compression?","Byte pair encoding (BPE) or digram coding is a simple and robust form of data compression in which the most common pair of contiguous bytes of data in a sequence are replaced with a byte that does not occur within the sequence. A lookup table of the replacements is required to rebuild the original data. The algorithm was first described publicly by Philip Gage in a February 1994 article ""A New Algorithm for Data Compression"" in the C Users Journal.

A variant of the technique has shown to be useful in several natural language processing (NLP) domains, for applications such as tokenisation, as seen in Google's SentencePiece and OpenAI's GPT-3. Here, the goal is not data compression, but tokenisation of text in a given language to produce a variable sequence of terms from a fixed-size vocabulary of tokens. Typically, most words will be encoded as a single token, while rare words will be encoded as a sequence of a few tokens, where these tokens represent meaningful word parts. This translation of text into tokens can be found by variants of byte pair encoding, such as subword units.

Byte pair encoding lends itself to NLP tasks due to its simplicity and speed; BPE is suitably effective for the tokenisation of terms, does not require large computational overheads, and remains consistent, making it reliable.",An alternate use for byte pair encoding besides compression would be tokenization.  Tokenization can be used in Natural Language Processing to encode tokens of words for simplicity and speed in NLP tasks.,closed_qa

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?,,"The answer to this depends on various factors.  If the wood if very heavy, a woodchuck may not be capable of chucking it at all.  If the pieces are smaller and the woodchuck was relatively young and spritely, then they could probably chuck at least 30 to 40lbs within a few hours.  An older woodchuck may no longer have dexterity in its hands or the sufficient strength needed to chuck any piece of wood regardless of its size or weight.",general_qa
What is the best way to understand event based data?,,"The best way to understand event based data depends on the particular questions you're trying to answer. If you're looking for overall trends in data, then counting the data, perhaps grouped by time frames and another logical grouping, then graphing the resulting time series works best. If instead you're trying to understand how the data is broken down into groups, selecting a time frame as a filter and then visualizing the groups with a heat map or scatter chart may work better.",general_qa
